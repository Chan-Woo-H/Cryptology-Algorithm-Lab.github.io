# About C&A Lab

We are Cryptology & Algorithm Lab and our leader is Professor [Jae Hong Seo](https://sites.google.com/site/jhsbhs/). Our main research interests are in cryptography especially zero-knowledge proof. Besides cryptography, We're interested in artificial intelligence using deep learning such as face recognition and speaker recognition.
