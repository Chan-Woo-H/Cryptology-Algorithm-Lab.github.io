        In page of "Verifiable computing" of wikipedia, Verifiable computing (or verified computation or verified computing) enables a computer to offload the computation of some function, to other perhaps untrusted clients, while maintaining verifiable results. The other clients evaluate the function and return the result with a proof that the computation of the function was carried out correctly. The introduction of this notion came as a result of the increasingly common phenomenon of "outsourcing" computation to untrusted users in projects such as <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI@home">SETI@home</A> and also to the growing desire of weak clients to outsource computational tasks to a more powerful computation service like in cloud computing.

        Secure Machine Learning (Cryptographic Approach)
    </summary>
    <br>
    <p>With the successful development of deep learning, biometric authentication technology based on convolutional neural networks has remarkably advanced.<br>
    <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698/">ArcFace</A> based on <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">Residual neural network</A>, one of the convolutional neural networks, is the recent state-of-the-art face recognition system and outputs highly discriminative feature templates for face authentication using additive angular margin loss.<br>
    However, when face recognition system become able to compress well into feature template from face image more and more, leakage of face templates is more serious threat to user privacy. For example, face images can be reconstructed from face feature templates using <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00832">neighborly de-convolutional neural network</A> and this is serious threat to user privacy.</p>
    Therefore we develop a modular architecture for protecting face feature templates that can be combined with any face recognition system that using angular distance metric such as <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08063">SphereFace</A>, <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09414">CosFace</A>, <A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698">ArcFace</A>.
